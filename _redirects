# Render Redirects Configuration
# This file enables client-side routing for the PayU Payment Integration Hub
# All routes are redirected to the main HTML file which handles the routing

# Redirect all paths to index.html with 200 status (SPA mode)
# This allows URLs like /crossborder, /subscription, etc. to work
/*    /payu_multiflow_original_design4.html    200

# Alternative: If you rename the file to index.html, use this instead:
# /*    /index.html    200
